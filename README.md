### Reflection

This was a 2 week long project built during Quantum HackMx 2021 by four collaborators: Francisco Ariel Arenas, Guillermo Hernandéz, Michelle Sanchéz, and Oscar Rogelio Medina. The project goals included using technologies learned in university and implement them to create solution to Liverpool's challenge.

One of the main challenges we ran into was the implementation between frontend and firestore, and the integration of a Dialogflow Bot in React JS. Due to project time constraints, we didn't implemented the best practices regarding security on the communication between the app and the database.

After all, we learned a lot about React, firestore, git, and Github during this projects and now we feel more confident to follow new projects and go into more depth in these technologies.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router, Redux, Dialogflow, Kommunicate, Firebase, JavaScript and CSS. We chose to create an app from scratch and used webpack to complie JavaScript modules. For deployment, we used Github pages and travis-ci.org.
